## Description

Sensors are a data source very important for robots. Because of them, they can recognize its environment and get information very valious about it.

Specifically, the camera is the most complex sensor that exist and, at the same time, it provide a great flow of data. Thank of that, useful algorithms can be elaborated for robot environment recognition. For example, **Neural Networks**.

## Course Targets

* Most common robot sensors types.

* Getting data by the sensors.

* 2D processing of cameras information with OpenCV.

* 3D sensorial data management.

* 3D processing of RGBD cameras information with **PCL** (Point Cloud Library).

* Trials with simulated and real robots.
