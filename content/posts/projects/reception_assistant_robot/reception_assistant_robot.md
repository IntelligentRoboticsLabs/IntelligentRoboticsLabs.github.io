In this project Pepper becomes an assistant receptionist in the Acciona's office. Among its main functions are to guide visitors to the different meeting rooms, to book a restaurant nearby, to book a taxi or to notify your arrival with a phone call to the meeting host. The robot has a Natural Language Processing (NLP) module to improve the Human-Robot interaction.
