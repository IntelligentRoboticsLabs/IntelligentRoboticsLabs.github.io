[Robobo project](https://theroboboproject.com/en/?lang=en) combines a simple mobile base with a smartphone to create complete mobile educational robots. The framework is organized into three skill levels:

* Scratch blocks for starting programmers,
* Python and JavaScript libraries for intermediate ones,
* and JAVA Android or ROS libraries for advanced users.

In addition to these features, this project has tried to develop the framework for more advanced users in ROS2. It consists of a series of ROS2 nodes that offer services to be able to send commands to the base, such as publishers who update the state of the robot, in addition to offering the information collected by the mobile camera that is located above the base. This technology has been developed for iOS and Android phones.
