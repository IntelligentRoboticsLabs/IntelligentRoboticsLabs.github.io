Robot Operating System (ROS) Is the most used software around the world for robot programming. Since its beginnings, in 2006, its usage has been extended unstoppably. Nowadays, it is the standard in the robotic world. It is a main tool in the investigation field and it is an essential requirement to be able to access the working world in any job related to the robotic.

ROS is an ** open source ** robot programming framework, made up of a collection of libraries and tools. It defines a distributed architecture to create complex software for robots efficiently and strongly. With ROS, software for most of the robots that exist can be developed (Nao, Pepper, PR2, Baxter, Kobuki, Turtlebot, AR-Drone, Lego NXT, Bebop Drone, RB-1…). Also, you can use any sensor (LIDAR, cameras, RGB-D sensors…) or actuators like robotic arms.
